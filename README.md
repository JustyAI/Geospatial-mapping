# Geospatial-mapping
Hi, welcome to JustyAI. I'm a Data Scientist and researcher with years of experience. In this repository, I will share the method of joining two different geometry datasets together for alignment to facilitate upcoming tasks such as machine learning and data analyisi. 

In our demo here, I used the open source data from Transport for London for Bus Routes Geometry and Bus Stops (Latitude and Longitude) Data. Nevertheless, the technique can be applied to other similar Geospatial or GIS related projects.

Open source data from TfL:
